## üìò About this project

The HTML page [`core-area-2-python-examples.html`](core-area-2-python-examples.html) contains:

- ‚úÖ All required Python commands from the official specification  
- ‚úÖ Short, clear explanations in plain English  
- ‚úÖ Runnable example code written for Python 3.10+  
- ‚úÖ Inline `# Output:` comments to demonstrate expected results  
- ‚úÖ Simple structure for use in chatbots, copilots, and digital learning systems  

The examples strictly follow the approved Appendix 2 command set and **do not include any external libraries or syntax** beyond those listed in the specification.
